# Clear Labs Google Data Studio Connector

## Community Connectors

[Community
Connectors](https://developers.google.com/datastudio/connector/overview) are
developed using [Apps Script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/) and
let users fetch data from external sources into their Data Studio dashboards.

The majority of open sourced Community Connectors have been deployed so that you
can try them out in Data Studio. The deployments are managed by the Data Studio
Developer Relations team and use the latest code for each Community Connector.

### Other open source Community Connectors

These repositories and deployed connectors are maintained by the respective
developers:

- [data.world](https://github.com/datadotworld/data-studio-connector)
    - *The data.world connector for Google Data Studio allows users to create
      reports with data pulled from one or more data.world datasets using SQL
      queries. data.world is designed for data and the people who work with
      data.  From professional projects to open data, data.world helps you host
      and share your data, collaborate with your team, and capture context and
      conclusions as you work.*
